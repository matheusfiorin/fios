A minimal and extensible flavour ~

## Disclaimer

This is a personal Emacs setup and maybe isn't going to work in your environment right now, considering that this is still a work in progress and it's based on what I use.

## Installation

Simply clone this repo at your `~/.emacs.d/` (or whatever Emacs root you've setted):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:matheusfiorin/fios.git ~/.emacs.d
```
